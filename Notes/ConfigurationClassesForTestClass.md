### [main] INFO org.springframework.test.context.support.AnnotationConfigContextLoaderUtils -- Could not detect default configuration classes for test class [com.shreyasagar.notification.RealTimeNotificationSystemApplicationTests]: RealTimeNotificationSystemApplicationTests does not declare any static, non-private, non-final, nested classes annotated with @Configuration.

This log message indicates that the Spring Test Context framework is unable to find a default configuration class for the test class `RealTimeNotificationSystemApplicationTests`.

---

#### What Does It Mean?
Spring tries to load the application context during the test execution. For this, it needs a configuration class or XML configuration to define the beans and settings. When Spring cannot find a valid configuration class, it logs this message.

Specifically, the message is saying:
1. **No configuration class detected**: Spring looked for a nested class annotated with `@Configuration` inside `RealTimeNotificationSystemApplicationTests` but couldn't find one.
2. **What it looked for**: A **static**, **non-private**, and **non-final nested class** with the `@Configuration` annotation.

---

#### Why Is This Happening?

1. **No Configuration Provided**:
    - Your test class (`RealTimeNotificationSystemApplicationTests`) does not specify how Spring should configure the application context.
    - You might have missed adding the appropriate annotations or pointing Spring to a configuration class.

2. **Misconfiguration**:
    - If you're using annotations like `@SpringBootTest`, but Spring cannot detect the main application class or configuration.

---

#### How to Fix It?

##### 1. Ensure `@SpringBootTest` is Present
Add the `@SpringBootTest` annotation to your test class. It tells Spring Boot to load the application context using the main application class:

```java
@SpringBootTest
public class RealTimeNotificationSystemApplicationTests {

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
        // Test logic here
    }
}
```

---

##### 2. Check the Main Application Class
Spring Boot typically detects the main application class (`@SpringBootApplication`) and uses it as the default configuration. Ensure your main application class is correctly defined and located in the base package. Example:

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class RealTimeNotificationSystemApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(RealTimeNotificationSystemApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

---

##### 3. Provide an Explicit Configuration Class
If the default detection does not work or your configuration is in a separate class, point Spring to it explicitly:

```java
@SpringBootTest(classes = MyAppConfig.class)
public class RealTimeNotificationSystemApplicationTests {
    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }
}
```

Here, `MyAppConfig` is your configuration class annotated with `@Configuration` or similar annotations.

---

##### 4. Nested Configuration Class (if necessary)
If you want to use a nested configuration class, ensure it is:
- **Static**: It must be declared `static`.
- **Non-private**: It must be accessible.
- Annotated with `@Configuration`.

Example:
```java
@SpringBootTest
public class RealTimeNotificationSystemApplicationTests {

    @Configuration
    static class TestConfig {
        // Bean definitions for testing
    }

    @Test
    void contextLoads() {
    }
}
```

---

#### Summary
The error occurs because Spring cannot find a configuration class for your test. Using `@SpringBootTest` and ensuring the correct setup of your main application or configuration class should resolve the issue.
